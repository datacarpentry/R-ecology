This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. These lessons can be taught in 3/4 of a day. They start with some
basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to
import CSV files, the structure of data.frame, how to deal with factors, how to
add/remove rows and columns, and finish with how to calculate summary statistics
for each level and a very brief introduction to plotting.

## Organization of the repository

The lessons are written in Rmarkdown using the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/home/getting-started.html) format.
